I'm going to analyze some data on the brain and body weights of different animals. First I'll import that data into R.

```{r}
bb <-read.csv("C:/Users/sspeir1/Downloads/Animals2.csv")
```

Next I'll take a quick look at the data

```{r}
names(bb)
nrow(bb)
ncol(bb)
head(bb)
```

I'm going to make a graph of body size versus brain size.

```{r}
plot(x=bb$body, y=bb$brain)
abline(lm(bb$brain~bb$body))
```

It looks like there is very little correlation between brain weight and body weight.

```{r}
t.test(bb$body, bb$brain)
```

The t-test supports no relationship between brain and body weight.
